### Unfixed Bugs

I am still working on fixing bugs throughout my project. 

## Deployment

To deploy my project, Codestar, I began by setting up a GitHub repository, where I uploaded all project files and ensured that the code was well-structured and organized. I created a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from being tracked, ensuring a clean repository. After committing and pushing the code to GitHub, I configured the repository settings to enable continuous integration, which allows for automatic testing and deployment updates.

Next, I proceeded to deploy Codestar on Heroku. I created a new Heroku app via the Heroku dashboard and connected it to my GitHub repository for seamless deployment. I configured the necessary environment variables, including database settings and secret keys, to ensure that the application runs smoothly in the Heroku environment. After setting up the required build packs and confirming that all dependencies were listed in the requirements.txt file, I initiated the deployment process. Once the build completed successfully, I verified that the application was live and fully functional on Heroku, allowing users to access Codestar with ease.
